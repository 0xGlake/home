# Agency
## How Agency and Courage are related
Courage can be a function of knowledge, consider the following categories of tasks:

 1. Things that are **easy** - These don't require courage like walking or drinking water
 2. Things that are **impossible** - The laws of physics prevent you from creating a perpetual motion machine
 3. Things that are **hard** - if you try something you're not going to succeed right away but you can with effort

People with low agency often struggle to believe they can succeed at hard tasks. In contrast, those with high agency approach challenges with hope and determination.

## Developing Agency

To develop agency (and therefore hope) you need to be able to see the future and be able to make decisions that will lead to success 

 - learn how to succeed
 - practice and experience personal victories
 - observe others like you succeed
 - reframe failure as a learning opportunity

High agency manifests as a hopeful outlook that resembles courage. It's the belief that you can influence your future through your actions.


If you have hope (high agency) you should find ways to spread it to benefit humanity and for personal fulfillment

Seek out people who are optimistic and have high hope to build agency

Remember: High agency is high hope that looks like courage and its highly contagious.
