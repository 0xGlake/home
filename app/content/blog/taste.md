Courage can be a function of knowledge, consider the following

There exists 3 kinds of tasks

 - Things that are **easy** - don't require courage like walking or drinking water
 - Things that are **impossible** - the laws of physics prevent you from creating a perpetual motion machine
 - Things that are **hard** - if you try something you're not going to succeed right away but you can with effort
   - Low agency have no hope that things in the hard category will work out for them

To gain agency (and therefore hope) you need to be able to see the future and be able to make decisions that will lead to success

 - learn how to succeed
 - practice (see yourself succeed)
 - see other people like you succeed
 - see failure as a recoverable experience

High agency is high hope that looks like courage


If you have hope (high agency) you should find ways to spread it to benefit humanity and for personal fulfillment

Seek out people who are optimistic and have high hope to build agency
